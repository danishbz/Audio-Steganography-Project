Audio Steganography Project

This project explores the realm of audio steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method to embed hidden messages within audio files. Leveraging a set of Python functions, this project demonstrates how to subtly manipulate audio data to store and retrieve messages without affecting audio quality perceptibly.
Key Features

    String to Bits Conversion: The project starts with converting the input string message into a binary form using the convert_Str_to_Bits function. Each character of the string is transformed into an 8-bit binary representation, with a # character appended to denote the message's end.

    Message Embedding: With merge_Frames_and_LSBs, the binary bits of the message are merged into the least significant bits of audio frame bytes. This embedding process is achieved without distorting the original audio quality.

    Encoding and Decoding:
        encode_File: Encodes a given message into an audio file, producing a new, modified audio file with the message hidden within its audio frames.
        decode_File: Extracts and reconstructs the hidden message from the modified audio file, ensuring the integrity of the original message.

    Practical Example: Demonstrates the process using the secret message "Father Christmas does not exist," showcasing the LSB method's effectiveness in concealing and retrieving data.

Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-steganography.git
cd audio-steganography
```

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Typically, you'll need:

```
pip install wave
```

Usage
Encoding a Message

Use the encode_File function to embed your secret message within an audio file:

```
from your_module import encode_File

SECRET_MESSAGE = 'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind'
SOURCE_FILE = "input_audio.wav"
MODIFIED_FILE = "output_audio.wav"

encode_File(SOURCE_FILE, SECRET_MESSAGE, MODIFIED_FILE)
```

Decoding a Message

Retrieve the hidden message with the decode_File function:

```
from your_module import decode_File

decoded_message = decode_File("output_audio.wav")
print(f'Decoded message: {decoded_message}')
```

Potential Applications

    Secure Communication: Conceal private messages within audio files.
    Digital Rights Management: Embed ownership details within digital products.
    Data Integrity Verification: Use hidden messages to ensure file authenticity.
